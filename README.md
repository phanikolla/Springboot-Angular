# Springboot-Angular
This repository contains spring boot applications with Angular as Frontend

In this full-stack development tutorial, we will learn how to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application using Angular 12 as a front-end and Spring boot as a backend.

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.

Spring Boot is a very popular Java framework for building Restful Webservices and Microservices.

Angular Spring boot Full-Stack Architecture
The application will be constructed using the following architecture:

What we will build?
Basically, we will create two projects:
1) Springboot-backend: This project is used to develop CRUD RESTFul APIs for a simple Employee Management System using Spring Boot, JPA, and MySQL as a database.
2) Angular-frontend: This project is used to develop single page application using Angular 12 as front-end technology. This Angular application consumes CRUD Restful APIs developed and exposed by a springboot-backend project.
